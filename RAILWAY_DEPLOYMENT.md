# 🚂 Railway Deployment - Fixed!

Your Railway deployment failed because of missing packages. Here's the fix:

## ✅ **Solution: Push Updated Files**

I've updated these files:
1. `requirements.txt` - Removed unavailable packages
2. `railway.toml` - Set Python 3.11

**Push these changes:**

```bash
git add requirements.txt railway.toml
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - remove unavailable packages"
git push
```

---

## 🔄 **Railway Will Auto-Deploy**

After pushing, Railway will automatically:
1. Detect the changes
2. Rebuild with Python 3.11
3. Install only available packages
4. Deploy your server

**Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment.**

## ⚙️ **What Changed:**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
strands-agents  ❌ Not available publicly
bedrock-agentcore  ❌ Not available publicly
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
fastapi  ✅ Available
uvicorn  ✅ Available
boto3  ✅ Available
```

**Your server has fallback logic, so it will work without strands packages!**

---

## 🎯 **Railway Configuration:**

### **Environment Variables to Add:**

After deployment succeeds, add these in Railway dashboard:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = your_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = us-east-1
PORT = 8000
```

---

## 📋 **Complete Steps:**

### Step 1: Push Fixes
```bash
git add requirements.txt railway.toml RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment"
git push
```

### Step 2: Wait for Railway
- Railway auto-detects changes
- Rebuilds with Python 3.11
- Deploys successfully
- **Wait 3-5 minutes**

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Add AWS credentials

### Step 4: Get Backend URL
- Railway shows your URL
- Example: `https://campaign-api-production.up.railway.app`
- **Copy this URL!**

### Step 5: Add to Amplify
1. Go to Amplify Console
2. Environment variables
3. Add: `VITE_API_URL` = Your Railway URL
4. Redeploy

---

## ✅ **Verification:**

### Test Backend:
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

---

## 🚨 **If Still Fails:**

### Check Railway Logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click latest deployment
4. View logs for errors

### Common Issues:

**Error: "Module not found"**
- Make sure all packages in `requirements.txt` are public
- Remove any private/internal packages

**Error: "Python version"**
- `railway.toml` sets Python 3.11
- Should work now

---

## 💡 **Your Server Works Without Strands!**

Your `simple_dashboard_server.py` has this logic:

```python
try:
    from market_campaign import ...
    AGENTS_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    AGENTS_AVAILABLE = False
    # Server still works with demo mode!
```

**So it will work even without strands packages!** ✅

---

## 🎯 **Summary:**

1. ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` - removed unavailable packages
2. ✅ Created `railway.toml` - set Python 3.11
3. ✅ Server has fallback logic - works without strands
4. ✅ Push changes - Railway auto-deploys

**Push the changes and Railway should deploy successfully!** 🚀

---

**After successful deployment:**
1. Copy Railway URL
2. Add to Amplify as `VITE_API_URL`
3. Test your app
4. Done! ✅
