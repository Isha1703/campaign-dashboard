# üöÄ AWS Amplify Deployment Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to deploy your Campaign Dashboard on AWS Amplify.

## üìã Overview

**What we're deploying:**
- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify (React app)
- **Backend**: AWS App Runner or EC2 (Python API)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (media files)

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes
**Cost:** ~$30-70/month

## üéØ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Part 1: Upload to GitHub (Required First)

AWS Amplify deploys from GitHub, so we need to upload your code first.

#### 1. Commit Your Code
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Campaign Dashboard"
```

#### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `campaign-dashboard`
3. Description: `AI-powered marketing campaign management platform`
4. Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click **Create repository**

#### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/campaign-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Your code is now on GitHub!

---

### Part 2: Deploy Backend (Python API)

You have two options for backend:

#### Option A: AWS App Runner (Recommended - Easier)

1. **Go to AWS App Runner Console:**
   - https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/

2. **Create Service:**
   - Click "Create service"
   - Source: **Source code repository**
   - Connect to GitHub
   - Select your repository: `campaign-dashboard`
   - Branch: `main`

3. **Configure Build:**
   - Build settings: **Configure all settings here**
   - Runtime: **Python 3**
   - Build command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -r mcp_requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start command:
     ```bash
     python simple_dashboard_server.py
     ```
   - Port: `8000`

4. **Add Environment Variables:**
   Click "Add environment variable" for each:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = your_secret_key
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = us-east-1
   PORT = 8000
   ENVIRONMENT = production
   ```

5. **Configure Service:**
   - Service name: `campaign-dashboard-api`
   - Virtual CPU: 1 vCPU
   - Memory: 2 GB
   - Auto scaling: Min 1, Max 3

6. **Create & Deploy:**
   - Click "Create & deploy"
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

7. **Get Backend URL:**
   - After deployment, copy the URL
   - Example: `https://abc123.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com`
   - **Save this URL!** You'll need it for frontend

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Backend is deployed and running!

#### Option B: AWS EC2 (More Control)

See detailed EC2 guide in [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

---

### Part 3: Deploy Frontend (React App) on AWS Amplify

#### 1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
- https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/

#### 2. Create New App
- Click "New app" ‚Üí "Host web app"
- Choose: **GitHub**
- Click "Connect branch"

#### 3. Authorize GitHub
- Click "Authorize AWS Amplify"
- Grant access to your repositories

#### 4. Select Repository
- Repository: `YOUR_USERNAME/campaign-dashboard`
- Branch: `main`
- Click "Next"

#### 5. Configure Build Settings

**App name:** `campaign-dashboard`

**Build settings** (auto-detected, but verify):
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:

- Click "Save and deploy"
- Wait 5-10 minutes for first deployment

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Frontend is deployed!

---

### Part 4: Connect Frontend to Backend

#### 1. Add Environment Variable in Amplify

1. **Go to your Amplify app**
2. **Click "Environment variables"** (left sidebar)
3. **Click "Manage variables"**
4. **Add variable:**
   - **Variable name:** `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value:** Your App Runner URL (from Part 2)
     - Example: `https://abc123.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com`
   - Click "Save"

#### 2. Redeploy Frontend

1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy this version"
3. Wait for deployment to complete

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Frontend can now talk to backend!

---

### Part 5: Configure CORS on Backend

Your backend needs to allow requests from your Amplify frontend.

#### 1. Update Backend Code

Edit `simple_dashboard_server.py` and update CORS:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com",  # Your Amplify URL
        "http://localhost:5173",  # Keep for local dev
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

#### 2. Get Your Amplify URL

1. Go to Amplify Console
2. Your app URL is shown at the top
3. Example: `https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com`

#### 3. Push Changes

```bash
git add simple_dashboard_server.py
git commit -m "Update CORS for Amplify"
git push
```

App Runner will automatically redeploy with new CORS settings.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** CORS configured!

---

### Part 6: Test Your Deployment

#### 1. Access Your App
- Go to your Amplify URL
- Example: `https://main.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com`

#### 2. Test Features
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Create a campaign
- [ ] Content generation works
- [ ] Images/videos load
- [ ] Analytics display
- [ ] No console errors (F12)

#### 3. Check Backend Health
```bash
curl https://your-apprunner-url.com/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy"}`

‚úÖ **Success!** Your app is live on AWS!
