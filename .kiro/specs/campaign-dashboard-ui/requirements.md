# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a professional-grade multi-tab dashboard UI for a marketing campaign multi-agent framework that integrates with AgentCore gateway. The UI will serve as a comprehensive platform where users can input product requirements, monitor real-time agent execution, review generated content (ads, images, videos) with S3 integration, provide approval/revision feedback, analyze campaign performance, and view budget optimization recommendations. The system will create a deployable link for the professional UI and ensure all generated content is properly displayed with loading indicators and interactive approval workflows.
