# Campaign Dashboard - Current Status

## 🎯 Summary

Your campaign dashboard is deployed on AWS Amplify but shows "Network Error" because **the backend server is not running**. Amplify only hosts the static frontend.

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ What's Working
- Frontend deployed on Amplify: https://main.d296oiluscvwnx.amplifyapp.com
- UI is fully functional and responsive
- Demo mode is available (mock data)
- All components and features are built

### ❌ What's Not Working
- Cannot create new campaigns (no backend)
- Cannot execute AI agents (no backend)
- Shows "Network Error" when trying to start campaigns
- No real session data available

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Enable Demo Mode (5 minutes)

**Best for**: Showcasing the UI immediately

1. Update Amplify environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_DEMO_MODE=true
   VITE_API_URL=
   ```

2. Redeploy on Amplify

3. Dashboard will use mock data to demonstrate features

**Result**: UI works with sample data, but no real campaigns

### Option 2: Deploy Backend (30 minutes)

**Best for**: Full functionality with real campaigns

#### Quick Deploy with Railway:

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login to Railway
railway login

# 3. Deploy backend
railway up

# 4. Get backend URL
railway status

# 5. Update Amplify environment:
#    VITE_DEMO_MODE=false
#    VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# 6. Update CORS in simple_dashboard_server.py:
#    Add your Amplify URL to allow_origins

# 7. Redeploy on Amplify
```

**Result**: Full functionality with real AI-powered campaigns

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Demo Mode)
1. ✅ Update `.env.production` to enable demo mode
2. ✅ Redeploy on Amplify
3. ✅ Test with mock data

### Short-term (Full Functionality)
1. Deploy backend to Railway/Render/EC2
2. Configure environment variables
3. Update CORS settings
4. Test real campaign creation

### Long-term (Production)
1. Set up proper database (RDS/DynamoDB)
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. Add monitoring and logging
4. Implement authentication
5. Set up CDN for media files

- **[AMPLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./AMPLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Detailed Amplify deployment guide
- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Project overview and setup
- **[.env.production](./.env.production)** - Production environment config

## 💡 Why This Happens

AWS Amplify is a **static site hosting** service. It can only serve:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
- Static assets (images, fonts)
- Pre-built React apps

It **cannot run**:
- Python backend servers
- AI agent execution
- Database operations
- Real-time processing

That's why you need a separate backend deployment.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Network Error" when creating campaigns
- **Cause**: Backend not running
- **Fix**: Deploy backend or enable demo mode

### No sessions showing
- **Cause**: No campaigns have been created
- **Fix**: Create a campaign (requires backend) or use demo mode

### CORS errors
- **Cause**: Backend doesn't allow Amplify URL
- **Fix**: Add Amplify URL to CORS configuration

## 📞 Support

Need help? Check:
1. Amplify Console logs
2. Backend logs (if deployed)
3. Browser console for errors
4. Network tab for failed requests

## 🎯 Current Configuration

```env
# .env.production (Current)
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true
VITE_API_URL=

# Backend CORS (simple_dashboard_server.py)
allow_origins=[
    "https://main.d296oiluscvwnx.amplifyapp.com",
    "http://localhost:5173",
]
```

## ✅ Action Items

**To fix the "Network Error" immediately:**

1. **Option A: Demo Mode**
   - Already configured in `.env.production`
   - Just redeploy on Amplify
   - Works with mock data

2. **Option B: Deploy Backend**
   - Follow [AMPLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./AMPLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - Deploy to Railway/Render/EC2
   - Update Amplify environment variables
   - Full functionality with real campaigns

Choose Option A for quick demo, Option B for production use.
