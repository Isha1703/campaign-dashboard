# Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Railway Backend Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites
- [ ] Railway account created
- [ ] GitHub repository connected to Railway
- [ ] AWS credentials ready (for S3 and Bedrock)

### 2. Railway Configuration
- [ ] Project created in Railway
- [ ] Repository connected
- [ ] Dockerfile detected automatically

### 3. Environment Variables (Railway Dashboard)
```env
# Required
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# Optional (for MCP tools)
AGENTCORE_API_KEY=your_key
AGENTCORE_ENDPOINT=https://api.agentcore.aws.dev

# Application
PORT=8000
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### 4. Build & Deploy
- [ ] Railway automatically builds Docker image
- [ ] Build completes successfully (Python 3.11)
- [ ] Dependencies installed (requirements.txt + mcp_requirements.txt)
- [ ] Server starts on dynamic PORT
- [ ] Health check passes

### 5. Get Backend URL
- [ ] Copy Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/test`
- [ ] Verify API docs: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`

## ‚úÖ Amplify Frontend Configuration

### 6. Update Environment Variables
Go to AWS Amplify Console ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Environment Variables:

```env
VITE_DEMO_MODE=false
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

### 7. Update CORS in Backend
Edit `simple_dashboard_server.py`:

```python
allow_origins=[
    "https://main.d296oiluscvwnx.amplifyapp.com",  # Your Amplify URL
    "https://your-app.railway.app",                 # Railway backend
    "http://localhost:5173",                        # Local dev
]
```

Commit and push - Railway will auto-redeploy.

### 8. Redeploy Amplify
- [ ] Trigger new deployment in Amplify Console
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Verify deployment successful

## ‚úÖ Testing

### 9. Backend Tests
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/test

# Expected: {"message": "Server is running", "timestamp": ...}

# API docs
open https://your-app.railway.app/docs
```

### 10. Frontend Tests
- [ ] Open Amplify URL: https://main.d296oiluscvwnx.amplifyapp.com
- [ ] No "Network Error" shown
- [ ] Can create new campaign
- [ ] Campaign form submits successfully
- [ ] Progress bar shows agent execution
- [ ] Content generation completes
- [ ] Analytics tab loads data
- [ ] Optimization tab shows recommendations

### 11. End-to-End Campaign Test
- [ ] Click "Create New Campaign"
- [ ] Fill in product details
- [ ] Set budget (e.g., $5000)
- [ ] Submit campaign
- [ ] Watch real-time agent logs
- [ ] Wait for completion (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Review generated content
- [ ] Check analytics data
- [ ] Test optimization recommendations

## ‚úÖ Monitoring

### 12. Railway Monitoring
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor CPU/Memory usage
- [ ] Set up alerts for downtime
- [ ] Review request logs

### 13. Amplify Monitoring
- [ ] Check build logs
- [ ] Monitor frontend errors
- [ ] Review CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Test from different browsers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Railway Build Fails
**Issue**: "No matching distribution found for strands-agents"
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Dockerfile now uses Python 3.11

**Issue**: Port binding error
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Server reads PORT from environment

### Amplify Shows Network Error
**Issue**: Cannot connect to backend
- [ ] Verify Railway URL is correct in VITE_API_URL
- [ ] Check CORS includes Amplify URL
- [ ] Test backend health endpoint directly

### CORS Errors
**Issue**: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" error
- [ ] Add Amplify URL to allow_origins in simple_dashboard_server.py
- [ ] Commit and push to trigger Railway redeploy
- [ ] Clear browser cache and retry

### Campaign Creation Fails
**Issue**: Agents don't execute
- [ ] Check AWS credentials in Railway
- [ ] Verify S3 bucket access
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Test MCP gateway connection
